\title{A function to call TreeTagger}
\usage{
treetag(file, treetagger = "kRp.env", rm.sgml = TRUE, lang = "kRp.env",
  apply.sentc.end = TRUE, sentc.end = c(".", "!", "?", ";", ":"),
  encoding = NULL, TT.options = NULL, debug = FALSE, TT.tknz = TRUE,
  format = "file", stopwords = NULL, stemmer = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Either a connection or a character vector, valid path to a file,
      containing the text to be analyzed.
If \code{file} is a connection, its contents will be written to a temporary file,
      since TreeTagger can't read from
R connection objects.}

\item{treetagger}{A character vector giving the TreeTagger script to be called. If set to \code{"kRp.env"} this is got from \code{\link[koRpus:get.kRp.env]{get.kRp.env}}.
Only if set to \code{"manual"},
      it is assumend not to be a wrapper script that can work the given text file, but that you would like
to manually tweak options for tokenizing and POS tagging yourself. In that case,
      you need to provide a full set of options with the \code{TT.options}
parameter.}

\item{rm.sgml}{Logical, whether SGML tags should be ignored and removed from output}

\item{lang}{A character string naming the language of the analyzed corpus. See \code{\link[koRpus:kRp.POS.tags]{kRp.POS.tags}} for all supported languages.
If set to \code{"kRp.env"} this is got from \code{\link[koRpus:get.kRp.env]{get.kRp.env}}.}

\item{apply.sentc.end}{Logical,
      whethter the tokens defined in \code{sentc.end} should be searched and set to a sentence ending tag.}

\item{sentc.end}{A character vector with tokens indicating a sentence ending. This adds to TreeTaggers results,
      it doesn't really replace them.}

\item{encoding}{A character string defining the character encoding of the input file,
      like  \code{"Latin1"} or \code{"UTF-8"}. If \code{NULL},
the encoding will either be taken from a preset (if defined in \code{TT.options}),
      or fall back to \code{""}. Hence you can overwrite the preset encoding with this parameter.}

\item{TT.options}{A list of options to configure how TreeTagger is called. You have two basic choices: Either you choose one of the pre-defined presets
   or you give a full set of valid options:
   \itemize{
     \item {\code{path}} {Mandatory: The absolute path to the TreeTagger root directory. That is where its subfolders \code{bin},
      \code{cmd} and \code{lib} are located.}
     \item {\code{preset}} {Optional: If you choose one of the pre-defined presets here:
     \itemize{
       \item {\code{"de-utf8"}} {German, UTF-8}
       \item {\code{"de"}} {German}
       \item {\code{"en"}} {English}
       \item {\code{"es-utf8"}} {Spanish, UTF-8}
       \item {\code{"es"}} {Spanish}
       \item {\code{"fr-utf8"}} {French, UTF-8}
       \item {\code{"fr"}} {French}
       \item {\code{"it-utf8"}} {Italian, UTF-8}
       \item {\code{"it"}} {Italian}
       \item {\code{"ru"}} {Russian, UTF-8}
     }
       you can omit all the following elements,
      because they will be filled with defaults. Of course this only makes sense if you have a
       working default installation.}
     \item {\code{tokenizer}} {Mandatory: A character string,
      naming the tokenizer to be called. Interpreted relative to \code{path/cmd/}.}
     \item {\code{tknz.opts}} {Optional: A character string with the options to hand over to the tokenizer. You don't need to specify "-a"
       if \code{abbrev} is given. If \code{TT.tknz=FALSE},
      you can pass configurational options to \code{\link[koRpus:tokenize]{tokenize}}
       by provinding them as a named list (instead of a character string) here.}
     \item {\code{tagger}} {Mandatory: A character string,
      naming the tagger-command to be called. Interpreted relative to \code{path/bin/}.}
     \item {\code{abbrev}} {Optional: A character string,
      naming the abbreviation list to be used. Interpreted relative to \code{path/lib/}.}
     \item {\code{params}} {Mandatory: A character string,
      naming the parameter file to be used. Interpreted relative to \code{path/lib/}.}
     \item {\code{lexicon}} {Optional: A character string,
      naming the lexicon file to be used. Interpreted relative to \code{path/lib/}.}
     \item {\code{lookup}} {Optional: A character string,
      naming the lexicon lookup command. Interpreted relative to \code{path/cmd/}.}
     \item {\code{filter}} {Optional: A character string,
      naming the output filter to be used. Interpreted relative to \code{path/cmd/}.}
     \item {\code{no.unknown}} {Optional: Logical,
      can be used to toggle the \code{"-no-unknown"} option of TreeTagger (defaults of \code{FALSE}.}
   }
You can also set these options globally using \code{\link[koRpus:set.kRp.env]{set.kRp.env}},
and then force \code{treetag} to use them by setting \code{TT.options="kRp.env"} here. Note: 
If you use the \code{treetagger} setting from kRp.env and it's set to \code{TT.cmd="manual"},
\code{treetag} will treat \code{TT.options=NULL} like \code{TT.options="kRp.env"} 
automatically.}

\item{debug}{Logical. Especially in cases where the presets wouldn't work as expected,
      this switch can be used to examine the values \code{treetag}
is assuming.}

\item{TT.tknz}{Logical,
      if \code{FALSE} TreeTagger's tokenzier script will be replaced by \code{koRpus}' function \code{\link[koRpus:tokenize]{tokenize}}.
To accomplish this,
      its results will be written to a temporal file which is automatically deleted afterwards (if \code{debug=FALSE}). Note that
this option only has an effect if \code{treetagger="manual"}.}

\item{format}{Either "file" or "obj",
      depending on whether you want to scan files or analyze the text in a given object, like
a character vector. If the latter,
      it will be written to a temporary file (see \code{file}).}

\item{stopwords}{A character vector to be used for stopword detection. Comparison is done in lower case. You can also simply set 
\code{stopwords=tm::stopwords("en")} to use the english stopwords provided by the \code{tm} package.}

\item{stemmer}{A function or method to perform stemming. For instance,
      you can set \code{SnowballC::wordStem} if you have
the \code{SnowballC} package installed. As of now,
      you cannot provide further arguments to this function.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[koRpus]{kRp.tagged-class}}. If \code{debug=TRUE},
      prints internal variable settings and attempts to return the
   original output if the TreeTagger system call in a matrix.
}
\description{
This function calls a local installation of TreeTagger[1] to tokenize and POS tag the given text.
}
\details{
Note that the value of \code{lang} must match a valid language supported by \code{\link[koRpus:kRp.POS.tags]{kRp.POS.tags}}.
It will also get stored in the resulting object and might be used by other functions at a later point.
E.g., \code{treetag} is being called by \code{\link[koRpus:freq.analysis]{freq.analysis}},
      which
will by default query this language definition,
      unless explicitly told otherwise. The rationale behind this
is to comfortably make it possible to have tokenized and POS tagged objects of various languages around
in your workspace, and not worry about that too much.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# first way to invoke POS tagging, using a built-in preset:
tagged.results <- treetag("~/my.data/speech.txt", treetagger="manual", lang="en",
   TT.options=list(path="~/bin/treetagger", preset="en"))
# second way, use one of the batch scripts that come with TreeTagger:
tagged.results <- treetag("~/my.data/speech.txt",
   treetagger="~/bin/treetagger/cmd/tree-tagger-english", lang="en")
# third option, set the above batch script in an environment object first:
set.kRp.env(TT.cmd="~/bin/treetagger/cmd/tree-tagger-english", lang="en")
tagged.results <- treetag("~/my.data/speech.txt")

# after tagging, use the resulting object with other functions in this package:
readability(tagged.results)
lex.div(tagged.results)

## enabling stopword detection and stemming
# if you also installed the packages tm and SnowballC,
# you can use some of their features with koRpus:
set.kRp.env(TT.cmd="manual", lang="en", TT.options=list(path="~/bin/treetagger",
   preset="en"))
tagged.results <- treetag("~/my.data/speech.txt",
   stopwords=tm::stopwords("en"),
   stemmer=SnowballC::wordStem)

# removing all stopwords now is simple:
tagged.noStopWords <- kRp.filter.wclass(tagged.results, "stopword")
}
