\usage{
cTest(obj, ...)

\S4method{cTest}{kRp.tagged}(obj, every = 2, min.length = 3,
  intact = c(start = 1, end = 1), replace.by = "_")
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class "kRp.tagged"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the method (as described in this document).}

\item{every}{Integer numeric,
      setting the frequency of words to be manipulated. By default,
every other word is being transformed.}

\item{min.length}{Integer numeric,
      sets the minimum length of words to be considered (in letters).}

\item{intact}{Named vector with the elements \code{start} and \code{end}. both must be integer values
and define, which sentences are to be left untouched,
      counted in sentences from beginning and end of the text.
The default is to ignore the first and last sentence.}

\item{replace.by}{Character, will be used as the replacement for the removed word halves.}
}
\value{
And object of class kRp.tagged, with an additional list \code{cTest} in its
   \code{desc} slot, listing the words which were changed.
}
\description{
If you feed a tagged text object to this function, its text will be transformed into
a format used for C-Tests:
\itemize{
   \item{the first and last sentence will be left untouched (except if the \code{start}
     and \code{stop} values of the \code{intact} parameter are changed}
   \item{of all other sentences, the second half of every 2nd word (or as specified by
     \code{every}) will be replaced by a line}
   \item{words must have at least \code{min.length} characters, otherwise they are
     skipped}
   \item{words an uneven number of characters will be replaced after the next character,
     i.e., a word with five characters will keep the first three and have the last two
     replaced}
}
