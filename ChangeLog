ChangeLog for package koRpus

changes in version 0.06-4 (2016-03-07)
fixed:
  - workaround for missing POS tag "NS" for english texts
  - made guess.lang() compatible with recent format of UDHR archives, now
    using ISO 639-3 codes as language identifier
  - tokenize() and treetag() weren't able to cope with text that only
    consisted of a single token
  - declared import from graphics package to satisfy CRAN checks
changed:
  - updated rkwarddev script according to recent development in the rkwarddev
    package
  - some basic validity checks of treetag()s "TT.options" moved to an
    internal function checkTTOptions(), which is now also called by set.kRp.env()
  - guess.lang() doesn't warn about missing EOL in the UDHR texts any longer
added:
  - added a README.md file
  - new option "no.unknown" can be passed to the "TT.options" of treetag(),
    to toggle the "-no-unknown" switch of TreeTagger
  - new option "validate" for set.kRp.env() to enable/disable checks

changes in version 0.06-3 (2015-11-02)
fixed:
  - actually query for supported POS tags in internal function
    is.supported.lang(). the function previously looked for supported languages in the
    available presets, which failed if there was no preset named like the language
    abberviation
  - made hyphen() not split words after first or before last character,
    therefore min.length was increased to 4 accordingly
  - adjusted test standards to changed hyphen results
added:
  - read.tagged() does now also accept matrix objects, see
    https://github.com/unDocUMeantIt/koRpus/issues/1

changes in version 0.06-2 (2015-09-21)
fixed:
  - read.corp.custom() calculated the in-document frequency wrong if analysis
    was performed case insensitive
  - updated some more links in the docs (?kRp.POS.tags)
changed:
  - correct.tag() now accepts all objects of class union kRp.taggedText
  - query() now uses "%in%" instead of "==" to match character strings
    against "query"
  - exported the previously internal function set.lang.support(), to prepare
    for the possibility of third party package to add new languages
added:
  - initial support to manually extend the languages supported by the
    package. you can now add new languages on-the-fly in a running session, or in a
    more sustainable manner by providing a language package (using the same
    methods, basically). key to this is the now globally available function
    set.lang.support(), and there's also two commented template scripts installed
    with the package, see the "templates" folder

changes in version 0.06-1 (2015-07-08)
fixed:
  - read.corp.custom() was buggy when dealing with tagged objects
  - suppress message stating text language in summary() for readability
    objects if "flat=TRUE"
changed:
  - changed the following functions into S4 methods: readability(),
    lex.div(), hyphen(), read.corp.custom() and freq.analysis()
  - removed long since deprecated function kRp.freq.analysis()
  - splitted the code of the monolithic internal function for
    read.corp.custom() into several subfunctions to get more flexibility
  - read.corp.custom() now also supports analysis of lists of tagged objects
  - removed option "fileEncoding" from the signature of read.corp.custom(),
    but it can still be used as part of the "..." options; this was neccessary
    because treetag() uses "encoding" instead
added:
  - new option "tagger" now also available in read.corp.custom()
  - there is now a mailing list to discuss the koRpus development:
    https://ml06.ispgateway.de/mailman/listinfo/korpus-dev_r.reaktanz.de

changes in version 0.05-6 (2015-06-30)
fixed:
  - changed "selected" values of checkboxGroupInput() in the shiny file ui.R
    to comply with the changes made in shiny 0.9.0
  - function kRp.text.transform() was missing some columns in TT.res
  - fixing this ChangeLog: the parameter for Szigriszt (Flesch ES) is not
    "es2", as reported in the log to koRpus 0.05.3, but "es-s"!
  - calling readability for "ARI.NRI" without hyphenation didn't work,
    allthough ARI doesn't need syllables
  - updated some broken links in the docs (?kRp.POS.tags, ?guess.lang)
  - added imports for 'utils' and 'stats' packages to comply with new CRAN
    checks
  - added a otherwise useless definition of "text" to the body of
    guess.lang(), also to satisfy R CMD check
changed:
  - replaced the RKWard plugin with a modularized rewrite (rkwarddev script)
  - some code cleaning in internal function kRp.rdb.formulae() and
    freq.analysis(), mostly replacing @ by slot()
added:
  - new readability formula tuldava(), kindly suggested by peter grzybek
  - the shiny app has gained support for Tuldava and Szigriszt (Flesch ES)
    formulae and log.base parameter (lexical diversity)
  - set.kRp.env() does now check whether a language preset is valid

changes in version 0.05-5 (2014-03-19)
changed:
  - removed Snowball from the list of suggested packages, as it is deprecated
    and fully replaced by SnowballC
  - re-generated all docs with roxygen2 3.1.0, which can now handle S4 class
    definitions properly
  - replaced all tabs in the source code by two space characters
added:
  - new tf-idf feature: read.corp.custom() now calculates idf, then
    freq.analysis() can use that to calculate tf-idf, kindly suggested by sandro tsang
  - new columns "inDocs" and "idf" in slot "words" of class kRp.corp.freq
  - new columns "tf", "idf" and "tfidf" in slot "words" of class kRp.txt.freq

changes in version 0.05-4 (2014-01-22)
fixed:
  - PCRE 8.34 caused the tests to fail because of problems with regular
    expressions in internal tokenizing function tokenz(); fixed by ensuring that
    "-" is being escaped as "\\-"

changes in version 0.05-3 (2013-12-21)
fixed:
  - due to a logical bug in calls to internal functions, the "lemmatize"
    argument if lex.div() didn't really have any effect
  - using file names with readability() and its wrappers was broken, works
    again now
changed:
  - the "tt" slot in class kRp.TTR gained two new entries, "lemmas" and
    "num.lemmas", kindly suggested by roberto trunfio
  - show() method for kRp.TTR objects now also lists the number of lemmas (if
    found)
  - parameters of Flesch formulae were slightly changed to be more accurate
    (from rounded values of 206.84 to 206.835) where applicable
  - Flesch-Szigriszt and Fernandez-Huerta have been validated against INFLESZ
    v1.0, so the warning was removed
  - readability.num() now gracefully accepts a single number of syllables for
    formulae who don't need to know more
  - added a proper GPL notice at the beginning of each R file
  - adjustet tests according to the changes made
added:
  - alternative Flesch parameters for spanish texts according to Szigriszt
    were added as parameters="es2", kindly suggested by carlos ortega
removed:
  - this is the first version of the package with slightly reduced sources on
    CRAN -- the debian directory, GPL license file and hyphenation pattern
    ChangeLog had to be removed. if you want the full sources to this package,
    please use the packages provided at http://reaktanz.de/?c=hacking&s=koRpus

changes in version 0.05-2 (2013-10-27)
fixed:
  - added two previously undocumented (and hence missing) italian tags "FW"
    and "LS"
  - removed some ::: operators which were not neccessary
  - updated slot "param" of kRp.TTR objects to include "min.tokens",
    "rand.sample", "window" and "log.base"
changed:
  - moved some parts of treetag() and kRp.text.paste() to internal functions
    for easier re-use of its functionality
added:
  - support for marco baroni's TreeTagger tagset for italian was added
  - added SnowballC to the suggested packages, as tokenize() and treetag()
    can also use SnowballC::wordStem() for stemming
  - new function read.tagged() can be used to import already tagged texts
  - new argument "apply.sentc.end" in function treetag()
  - new argument "log.base" in functions lex.div() and lex.div.num()

changes in version 0.05-1 (2013-05-05)
fixed:
  - DRP() readability formula tried to fetch a non-existing variable and
    hence didn't calculate; this also fixed a problem with summary(), if DRP
    results were expected in the object; tests had to be corrected as well
  - textFeatures() gets number of letters and TTR again
  - MTLD calculation (lex.div()) now counts a factor as full if it is <
    factor.size, it was implemented as <= factor.size before (thanks to scott
    jarvis for insight on the details)
  - summary() for kRp.TTR objects always showed MTLD, even if it was empty
changed:
  - vignette now describes the use of taggedText() and describe(), instead of
    direct access to slots
  - readability() now assumes that if there's any text, it represents at
    least one sentence, even if no sentence ending punctuation can be found
  - "quiet=TRUE" in readability(), readability.num(), lex.div() and
    lex.div.num() will now also suppress all warnings regarding validation status
  - MTLD calculation (lex.div()) was optimized and takes less than half of
    the time it used to. it also gained a new boolean argument "detailed", which
    is FALSE by default. this means that the full factor results are skipped
    now, which boosts performance even more (six times as fast as before)
  - the caching mechanism for hyphen() was restructured into internal
    functions, allowing for better access to the cached data
  - set.kRp.env() and get.kRp.env() have new signatures, namely, all
    previously hardcoded parameters have been replaced by the more flexible "...".
    usage stays the same, so there's no need to change any scripts, as long as
    you called all parameters by name, not only by position!
  - object class kRp.corp.freq can now have additional columns in slots
    "words" and "desc". this flexibility allows for using this class with valence
    data as well
  - query() now examines the desired columns to decide whether character or
    numeric operations are to be done
  - performance of hyphen() has been massively improved if cache=TRUE
  - guess.lang() now also standardizes the difference values; this was added
    to the respective summary() method, which also produces nicer output
  - the source code was re-organized a bit, to ensure classes and methods are
    found in an appropriate order; the collate roclet of roxygen2 had
    problems with this when running in R 3.0.0
added:
  - new function read.BAWL() to import BAWL-R data
  - new demo application for use with the "shiny" package, can be found in
    $SRC/inst/shiny
  - lex.div() now supports a new method for calculating MTLD (MTLDMA,
    moving-average)
  - new getter method hyphenText() to access the "hyphen" slot in kRp.hyphen
    objects
  - getter methods language() and describe() for kRp.hyphen objects also added
  - added "quiet" argument to lex.div.num()
  - guess.lang() can now analyze a given text directly, not only from files
  - set.kRp.env() can now explicitly unset parameters in the environment
  - set.kRp.env() and get.kRp.env() know a new parameter,
    "hyphen.cache.file", which can be set to a file name to read from/write to the hyphenation
    cache. this way you can easily restore cached hyphenation rules over
    sessions. if this parameter is set, it will be used by hyphen() automatically if
    called with "cache=TRUE"

changes in version 0.04-40 (2013-04-07)
fixed:
  - removed some non-ASCII characters, mostly from comments, to keep the
    package on CRAN; some author names are now spelled wrong, though...

changes in version 0.04-39 (2013-03-12)
fixed:
  - optimized tokenize() to also detect prefixes/suffixes of the defined
    heuristics if they co-occur with punctuation
  - re-saved hyph.fr.rda with explicitly UTF-8 ecoded vectors
  - renamed LICENSE to LINCENSE.txt, so it won't get installed, as demnanded
    by Writing R Extensions
changed:
  - the language specific heuristics "en" and "fr" in tokenize() were renamed
    into "suf" and "pre". but they are still available, with "fr" now
    activating both "suf" and "pre".
  - read.hyph.pat() now explicitly sets vector encoding to UTF-8 with
    Encoding()<-, to ensure that the generated objects don't cause warnings from R
    CMD check if they're included in packages
  - internally replaced paste(..., sep="") with paste0(...)
added:
  - added new getter/setter methods taggedText(), taggedText()<-, describe(),
    describe()<-, language() and language()<- for tagged text objects
  - added is.taggedText() test function
  - added a warning to treetag() if "TT.options" is not a list (because this
    will likely render the options meaningless if they *contain* a list).
  - tokenize() can now apply a list of patterns/replacements to given texts
    via the new "clean.raw" attribute, and even supports perl-like regular
    expressions. the replacements are done before the texts are tokenized, so this
    can be tried to globally clean up bad characters or simply replace
    strings, etc.
  - tokenize() and treetag() have a new option "stopwords" to enable stopword
    detection
  - kRp.filter.wclass() can now remove detected stopwords
  - tokenize() and treetag() have a new option "stemmer" to interface with
    stemmer functions/methods like Snowball::SnowballStemmer()

changes in version 0.04-38 (2012-11-30)
added:
  - added support for french (thanks to alexandre brulet)

changes in version 0.04-37 (2012-09-15)
fixed:
  - a typo in Spache calculation (substraction instead of addition of a
    constant) lead to wrong results
  - Spache now counts unfamiliar words only once, as explained in the
    original article
  - old Spache formula was missing in readability(index="all")
changed:
  - validated Linsear Write, Dale-Chall (1948) and Spache (1953) results and
    removed warnings
  - status messages of hyphen() and lex.div() have been replaced by a space
    saving prograss bar added
  - added tests for lex.div(), hyphen() and readability()

changes in version 0.04-36 (2012-08-27)
fixed:
  - tests should now work on any machine

changes in version 0.04-35 (2012-08-21)
changed:
  - using utf8-tokenizer.perl now in all UTF-8 presets, also on windows
    systems. the script is part of the windows installer of TreeTagger 3.2 (at
    least since june 2012)
fixed:
  - correct.*() methods now also update the descriptive statistics in
    corrected objects

changes in version 0.04-34 (2012-06-02)
added:
  - there's now a class union "kRp.taggedText" with the members "kRp.tagged",
    "kRp.analysis", "kRp.txt.freq" and "kRp.txt.trans"
changed:
  - advanced summary() statistics for objects returned by clozeDelete()
  - clozeDelete(offset="all") now iterates through all cloze variants and
    prints the results, including the new summary() data
  - clozeDelete() now uses the new class union "kRp.taggedText" as signature
  - read.corp.custom() now uses table(), "quiet" is TRUE by default, the new
    option "caseSens" can be used to ignore character case, and "corpus" can
    now also be a tagged text object
fixed:
  - summary() for objects of class kRp.txt.freq was broken
  - as("kRp.tagged") for objects of class kRp.txt.freq was broken

changes in version 0.04-33 (2012-05-26)
changed:
  - elaborated documentation for method cTest()
added:
  - added new method clozeDelete()
  - added new list "cTest" in desc slot of the objects returned by cTest(),
    which lists all words that were changed (in clozeDelete() this list is
    called "cloze")

changes in version 0.04-32 (2012-05-11)
added:
  - added new function jumbledWords() and new method cTest()
fixed:
  - kRp.text.paste() now also removes superfluous spaces at the end of texts
    (i.e., before the last fullstop)

changes in version 0.04-31 (2012-04-22)
added:
  - koRpus now suggests the "testthat" package and uses it for automatic tests
  - treetag() and tokenize() now also accept input from open connections
fixed:
  - treetag() shouldn't fail on file names with spaces any more

changes in version 0.04-30 (2012-04-06)
  - added features:
  - kRp.corp.freq class objects now include the columns 'lttr', 'lemma',
    'tag' and 'wclass'
  - query() for corpus frequency objects now returns objects of the same
    class, to allow nested queries
  - the 'query' parameter of query() can now be a list of lists, to
    facilitate nested requests more easily
  - query() can now invoke grepl(), if 'var' is set to "regexp"; i.e., you
    can now filter words by regular expressions (inspired by suggestions after
    the koRpus talk at TeaP 2012)

changes in version 0.04-29 (2012-04-05)
  - fixed bug in summary() for tagged objects without punctuation
  - renamed kRp.freq.analysis() to freq.analysis() (with wrapper function for
    backwards compatibility)
  - readability.num() can now directly digest objects of class kRp.readability
  - data documentation hyph.XX is now a roxygen source file as well
  - cleaned up summary() and show() docs
  - adjustements to the roxygen2 docs (methods)

changes in version 0.04-28 (2012-03-10)
  - code cleanup: initialized some variables by setting them NULL, to avoid
    needless NOTEs from R CMD check (hyphen(), and internal functions
    frqcy.by.rel(), load.hyph.pattern(), tagged.txt.rm.classes() and
    text.freq.analysis())
  - re-formatted the ChangeLog so roxyPackage can translate it into a NEWS.Rd
    file

changes in version 0.04-27 (2012-03-07)
  - prep for CRAN release:
  - 0.04-26 was short-lived...
  - really fixed plot docs
  - removed usage section from hyph.XX data documentation
  - renamed text.features() to textFeatures()
  - encapsulated examples in set.kRp.env()/get.kRp.env() in \dontrun{}
  - re-encoded hyph.XX data objects to UTF-8
  - replaces non-ASCII characters in code with unicode escapes

changes in version 0.04-26 (2012-03-07)
  - fixed plot docs
  - prep for inital CRAN release

changes in version 0.04-25 (2012-03-05)
  - re-compressed all hyphenation pattern data files, using xz compression
  - lifted the R dependency from 2.9 to 2.10
  - compressed LCC tarballs are now detected automatically
  - kRp.freq.analysis() now also lists the log10 value of word frequencies in
    the TT.res slot
  - in the desc slot of kRp.txt.freq class objects, the rather misleading
    list elements "freq" and "freq.wclass" were more adequately renamed to
    "freq.token" and "freq.types", respectively
  - unmatched words in frequency analyses now get value 0, not NA
  - fixed wrong signature for option "tagger" in kRp.text.analysis()
  - fixed kRp.cluster() which still called some old slots

changes in version 0.04-24 (2012-03-01)
  - fixed bug for attempts to calculate value distribution texts without any
    sentence endings
  - all readability wrapper functions now also accept a list of text features
    for calculation
  - class kRp.readability now inherits kRp.tagged
  - readability() now checks for presence of a hyphen slot and re-uses it, if
    no new hyphen object was provided; this in addition to the previous
    change enables one to re-analyze a text more efficiently, as already calculated
    results are also preserved
  - letter and character distribution in kRp.tagged desc slot now include
    columns with zero values if the respective values are missing (e.g., no words
    with five letters, but some with six, etc.)
  - added summary method for class kRp.tagged, summarizing main information
    from the desc slot
  - added plot method for class kRp.tagged
  - show method for kRp.readability now lists unfamiliar words for
    Harris-Jacobson
  - cleaned up code of lex.div.num() a bit

changes in version 0.04-23 (2012-02-24)
  - added precise RGL formula option to FORCAST
  - removed validation warnings from several indices, because results have
    been checked against those of other tools, and were comparable, so the
    implementations of these measures are assumed to be correct: - lex.div(): TTR,
    MSTTR, C, R, CTTR, U, Maas, HD-D, MTLD (thanks a lot to scott jarvis &
    phil mccarthy for calculating sample texts!) - readability(): ARI, ARI NRI,
    Bormuth, Coleman-Liau, Dale-Chall, Dale-Chall PSK, DRP,
    Farr-Jenkins-Paterson, Farr-Jenkins-Paterson PSK, Flesch, Flesch PSK, Flesch-Kincaid, FOG,
    FOG PSK, FORCAST, LIX, RIX, SMOG, Spache, Wheeler-Smith
  - moved all calculation from readability() to an internal function
    kRp.rdb.formulae(). to make it easier to write a similar function to lex.div.num()
    for the readability fomulas as well
  - added readability.num()
  - adjusted exsyl calculation for ELF to the approach used in other
    measures, which also results in a change of its default "syll" parameter from 1 to
    2; also corrected a typo in the docs, the index was proposed by Fang, not
    Farr
  - readability results now list letter distribution, not character
    distribution in desc slot
  - the desc slot from readability calculations was enhanced so that it can
    directly be used as the txt.features parameter for readability.num()
  - docs were polished

changes in version 0.04-22 (2012-02-08)
  - further fixes to the Wheeler-Smith implementation. according to the
    original paper, polysyllabic words need to be counted, and the example given
    shows that this means words with more than one syllable, not three or more,
    as Bamberger & Vanecek (1984) suggested
  - fixed HD-D, previous results are now labelled as ATTR in the HDD slot
  - adjusted HD-D.char calculation for small number of tokens (probabilities
    are now set to 1, not NaN)
  - added MATTR characteristics
  - show() for lex.div() objects now also reports SD for characteristics

changes in version 0.04-21 (2012-02-07)
  - MTLD now uses a slightly more efficient algorithm, inspired by the one
    used for MATTR
  - MSTTR now also reports SD of TTRs
  - differentiated the word class adposition into pre-, post- and
    circumposition in the language support for german and russian
  - added both Tränke-Bailer formulae to readability(), incl. wrapper
    traenkle.bailer() and show()/summary() methods
  - Coleman formulae now also count only prepositions as such
  - fixed Wheeler-Smith (thanks to eleni miltsakaki)

changes in version 0.04-20 (2012-02-06)
  - added Moving Average TTR (MATTR) to lex.div(), incl. wrapper  MATTR() and
    show()/summary() methods
  - added "rand.sample" and "window" to the parameters returned by lex.div()
  - further re-arranged the code of readability() and lex.div() to make it
    easier to maintain
  - summary(flat=TRUE) for readability objects is now a numeric vector

changes in version 0.04-19 (2012-02-02)
  - added five harris-jacobson readability formulae, incl. wrapper
    harris.jacobson() and show()/summary() methods
  - updated vignette
  - MTLD characteristics are now twice as fast
  - classes "kRp.txt.freq" and "kRp.txt.trans" now simply extend
    "kRp.tagged", and "kRp.analysis" extends "kRp.txt.freq"
  - removed internal function check.kRp.object() (globally replaced by
    inherits())
  - fixed letter count issue in readability()
  - fixed bugs in loading word lists in readability()
  - fixed crash if index="all" in readability()
  - reordered default kRp.readabilty slot order alphabetically, as well as
    show() and summary() for readability results
  - renamed results of the Neue Wiener Sachtextformeln from WSTF* to nWS* in
    readability object methods show() and summary() for consistency
  - renamed WSFT() to nWS() for the same reason
  - cleaned up roxygen comments for more roxygen2 compliance

changes in version 0.04-18 (2012-01-22)
  - added missing word exclusion to Gunning FOG measure
  - added sentence length, word length, distribution of characters and
    letters to "desc" slot of class kRp.tagged and readability() results, where
    missing
  - both syllable (hyphen()) and character distributions gained inversed
    cummulation for absolute numbers and percentages, so this one table now makes
    it easy to see how many words with more/equal/less characters/syllables
    there are in a text
  - changed internals of kRp.freq.analysis() and readability() to re-use
    descriptives of tagged text objects
  - NOTE: this also changed the names of some result elements in their "desc"
    slots for overall consistency ("avg.sent.len" is now "avg.sentc.length",
    "avg.word.len" became "avg.word.length", and instances of "num.words",
    "num.chars" etc. lost the "num." prefix). in case you accessed these
    directly, check if you need to adopt these changes. this is a first round of
    changes towards 0.05, see the notes to 0.04-17 below!

changes in version 0.04-17 (2012-01-17)
  - replaced the english hyphenation parameter set with a new one, which was
    made with PatGen2 especially for koRpus
  - tokenize() will now interpret single letters followed by a dot as an
    abbreviation (e.g., of a name), not a sentence ending, if heuristics include
    "abbr"
  - fixed bug which caused hyphen() to drop syllables if only one pattern
    match was found
  - added cache support to the correct method of class kRp.hyphen
  - added number of words and sentences to "desc" slot of class kRp.tagged
  - elaborated treetag() error message if no TreeTagger command was specified
  - NOTE: koRpus 0.05 will likely merge some object classes similar to
    kRp.tagged, i.e. kRp.txt.freq and kRp.txt.trans, into one class for tokenized
    text, either replacing or inheriting those classes

changes in version 0.04-16 (2012-01-15)
  - added slot "desc" to class kRp.tagged, to have descriptive statistics
    directly available in the object
  - added support for descriptive statistics to tokenize() and treetag()
  - added function text.features() to extract a 9-features set from texts for
    authorship detection (inspired by a talk at the 28C3)
  - hyphen() can now cache results on a per session basis, making it
    noticeably faster

changes in version 0.04-15 (2012-01-04)
  - manage.hyph.pat() is now an exported function
  - added initial support for italian (thanks to alberto mirisola)
  - added italian hyphenation patterns
  - changed min.length from 4 to 3 in hyphen() and manage.hyph.pat()
  - hyphen now considers hyphenating before last letters of a word
  - tuned hyph.en (with contributions by laura hauser)
  - fixed check for existing tokenizer, tagger and parameter file in treetag()
  - fixed MTLD calculation for texts which don't make even one factor

changes in version 0.04-14 (2011-12-22)
  - added new internal function manage.hyph.pat() to add/replace/remove
    pattern entries for hyphenation
  - added number of tokens per factor and standard deviation to MTLD results
    (thx to aris xanthos for the suggestion)

changes in version 0.04-13 (2011-11-22)
  - added column "token" to slots MTLD$all.forw and MTLD$all.back of
    lex.div() results, so you can verify the results more easily
  - slot HDD$type.probs of lex.div() results is now sorted (decreasing)
  - removed warnings of missing encoding, since enc2utf() seems to do a
    pretty good job

changes in version 0.04-12 (2011-11-21)
  - added support for the newer LCC .tar archive format
  - changed vignette accordingly
  - for consistency, changed "words" and "dist.words" into "tokens" and
    "types" in class kRp.corp.freq, slot desc
  - added lgeV0 and the relative vocabulary growth measures suggested by Maas
    to lex.div(); furthermore, a is now reported instead of a^2
  - added lgV0 and lgeV0 to lex.div.num()
  - show method for class kRp.TTR now excludes Inf values from
    charasteristics values

changes in version 0.04-11 (2011-11-20)
  - added function lex.div.num(), calculates TTR family measures by numbers
    of tokens and types directly
  - cleaned up lex.div() code a little

changes in version 0.04-10 (2011-11-19)
  - fixed missing 'input.enc' information if treetag() option 'treetagger' is
    not "manual" but a script
  - enhanced encoding handling internally if none was specified
  - changed default value of 'case.sens' to FALSE in lex.div(), as this seems
    to be more common
  - changed default value of 'fileEncoding' from "UTF-8" to NULL and use
    enc2utf() internally if no encoding was defined

changes in version 0.04-9 (2011-10-27)
  - tokenize() now converts all input to UTF-8 internally, to prevent
    conflicts later on (treetag() does that since 0.04-7 already)
  - added an experimental feature to treetag() to replace TreeTagger's
    tokenizer with tokenize()

changes in version 0.04-8 (2011-09-21)
  - fixed bugs in treetag(): "debug" now works without "manual" config as
    well, and global TT.options are now found if no preset was selected

changes in version 0.04-7 (2011-09-16)
  - added "encoding" option to treetag() and defaults to the language presets
  - fixed some option check and file path issues in treetag()

  - fixed dozends of small glitches in the docs which caused warnings during
    package checks

changes in version 0.04-4 (2011-08-23)
  - fixed bug in getting the right preset: mixed "lang" and "preset" during
    the modularization

changes in version 0.04-3 (2011-08-19)
  - modularized language support by the internal function set.lang.support(),
    this should make it much easier to add new languages in the future,
    because it means to add only one R file. hyphen(), kRp.POS.tags() and treetag()
    now use this new method
  - added CITATION file

changes in version 0.04-2 (2011-08-18)
  - fixed duplicate "PREP" definition in spanish POS tags, which caused
    treetag() to consume lots of RAM
  - fixed superfluous "es" definitions in treetag()

changes in version 0.04-1 (2011-08-16)
  - added support for spanish (thanks to earl brown)
  - docs can be created from source by roxygen2 (but all class docs are
    static, until '@slot' works again)

changes in version 0.03-4 (2011-08-09)
  - added support for autodetection of headlines and paragraphs in tokenize()
  - added support to revert autodetected headlines and paragraphs in
    kRp.text.paste()
  - updated RKWard plugin to use tokenize()

changes in version 0.03-3 (2011-08-08)
  - added parameters for formula C and simplified formula to SMOG
  - enhanced readability formulas (like adding age levels to Flesch.Kincaid,
    grade levels to LIX)
  - removed the duplicate Amstad index (is now just Flesch.de)

changes in version 0.03-2 (2011-08-03)
  - added the full RKWard plugin as inst/rkward, so both get updated
    simultanously
  - added experimental internal functions to import result logs from
    Readability Studio and TextQuest

changes in version 0.03-1 (2011-07-29)
  - integrated internal tags to kRp.POS.tags(), so tokenize() can return
    valid kRp.tagged class objects, i.e. substitute TreeTagger if it's not
    available
  - consequently renamed 'treetagger' option into 'tagger' in readability(),
    kRp.freq.analysis() and kRp.text.analysis()
  - lots of small fixes

changes in version 0.02-9 (2011-07-17)
  - added a simple tokenize() function
  - first working version of read.corp.custom()
  - added "..." option to readability, kRp.freq.analysis and
    kRp.text.analysis, to configure treetag()

changes in version 0.02-7 (2011-06-29)
  - fixed typo in kRp.POS.tags("ru"): "Vmis-sfa-e" tags no longer a "vern",
    but a "verb"
  - removed XML package dependency again, by writing a small parser (there
    was no windows binary for the XML package, which was obviously a problem...)
  - fixed "quiet" option in guess.lang()

changes in version 0.02-6 (2011-06-26)

    processing time - added option "in.mem" to switch back to previous behavious
    (temporary files)
  - added internal function is.supported.lang() as a possible wrapper for
    guessed ULIs
  - added internal functions roxy.description() and roxy.package() to ease
