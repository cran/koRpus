\usage{
harris.jacobson(txt.file, word.list, parameters = c(char = 6), hj1 = c(dword
  = 0.094, asl = 0.168, const = 0.502), hj2 = c(dword = 0.14, asl = 0.153,
  const = 0.56), hj3 = c(asl = 0.158, lword = 0.055, const = 0.355),
  hj4 = c(dword = 0.07, asl = 0.125, lword = 0.037, const = 0.497),

}
\arguments{
\item{txt.file}{Either an object of class \code{\link[koRpus]{kRp.tagged-class}},
      a character vector which must be be
a valid path to a file containing the text to be analyzed,
      or a list of text features. If the latter, calculation
is done by \code{\link[koRpus:readability.num]{readability.num}}.}

\item{word.list}{A vector or matrix (with exactly one column) which defines familiar words. For valid results
the short Harris-Jacobson word list for grades 1 and 2 (english) should be used.}

\item{parameters}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers,
      defining the relevant parameters for all formulas of the index.}

\item{hj1}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers for the first of the formulas.}

\item{hj2}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers for the second of the formulas.}

\item{hj3}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers for the third of the formulas.}

\item{hj4}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers for the fourth of the formulas.}

\item{hj5}{A numeric vector with named magic numbers for the fifth of the formulas.}

\item{...}{Further valid options for the main function,
      see \code{\link[koRpus:readability]{readability}} for details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[koRpus]{kRp.readability-class}}.
}
\description{
This is just a convenient wrapper function for \code{\link[koRpus:readability]{readability}}.
}
\details{
This function calculates the revised Harris-Jacobson readability formulas (1 to 5),
      as described in their paper for the
18th Annual Meeting of the College Reading Association (Harris & Jacobson,
      1974). In contrast to \code{\link[koRpus:readability]{readability}},
which by default calculates all possible indices,
      this function will only calculate the index values.

This formula doesn't need syllable count.
