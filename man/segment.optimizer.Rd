\title{A function to optimize MSTTR segment sizes}
\usage{
segment.optimizer(txtlgth, segment = 100, range = 20, favour.min = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{txtlgth}{Integer value, size of text in tokens.}

\item{segment}{Integer value, start value of the segment size.}

\item{range}{Integer value,
      range around \code{segment} to search for better fitting sizes.}

\item{favour.min}{Logical,
      whether as a last ressort smaller or larger segment sizes should be
prefered, if in doubt.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with two elements:
  \item{seg}{The optimized segment size}
  \item{drop}{The number of tokens that would be dropped using this segment size}
}
\description{
This function calculates an optimized segment size for \code{\link[koRpus:MSTTR]{MSTTR}}.
}
\details{
When calculating the mean segmental type-token ratio (MSTTR), tokens are divided into
segments of a given size and analyzed. If at the end text is left over which won't fill another
full segment, it is discarded,
      i.e. information is lost. For interpretation it is debatable
which is worse: Dropping more or less actual token material,
      or variance in segment size between
analyzed texts. If you'd prefer the latter, this function might prove helpful.

Starting with a given text length, segment size and range to investigate,
      \code{segment.optimizer}
iterates through possible segment values. It returns the segment size which would drop the fewest
tokens (zero, if you're lucky). Should more than one value fulfill this demand,
      the one nearest to
the segment start value is taken. In cases,
      where still two values are equally far away from the
start value,
      it depends on the setting of \code{favour.min} if the smaller or larger segment size
is returned.
